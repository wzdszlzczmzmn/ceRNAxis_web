### Bin-Level CNA Heatmap

`A CNA heatmap with samples as rows and chromosome-level genomic regions as columns, equied with zoomable cut-dendrogram and case meta annotation`


Over the past two decades, CNA heatmap has often been adopted to visualize the CNA profiles of a batch of samples in various sequencing protocols. e.g. bulk SNP array, whole genome/exon sequencing. CNA heatmap aids the landscape view of single case copy number in several pieces of literature. It is essential to reduce the size of heatmap while retaining the heterogeneity among cases. Cluster zoom-in operation is achieved by clicking the node in the dendrogram.  

Here, we build viz interface ''CNA Heatmap''  for interactive and real-time visualization of CNA landscape of a cancer project with zoomable dendrogram. With cases as rows and chromosome-level genomic regions as columns, the CNA heatmap exhibits the copy number of a specific case across the entire genome. The clinical meta heatmap is displayed on the left. A zoomable cut dendrogram is displayed on the left. If the mouse hovers over case CNA/meta heatmap, cutted dendrogram, and stairstep, an interactive tooltip carried its vital information will appear.

    When users click a node in the cutted dendrogram, the selected node will be regarded as the temporary tree root, and a new sub-cutted dendrogram will be rendered. The case CNA heatmap and meta panel will also be updated to fit the current case range. When you click the "Back to Root'' button, the whole CNA view will return to its initial status. You may also utilize the "Prev'' and "Next'' buttons to un-do and re-do zooming operations.
  + Various Settings </br>
    The left panel of the CNAScope visualization interface offers a comprehensive set of customizable settings to enhance the display and analysis of phylogenetic trees and heatmaps. The **Chart Setting** allows users to adjust general chart properties, while the **Tree Setting** enables fine-tuning of the tree layout with options such as `Width` (e.g., 300.0 units) and `Margin to HeatMap` (e.g., 20.0 units) to optimize spacing and alignment. The **Heatmap Setting** provides controls for `Block Width` (e.g., 2.0 units), `Block Height` (e.g., 10.0 units), `Block Gap` (e.g., 0.1 units), and `Chromosome Legend Height` (e.g., 25.0 units), allowing precise adjustments to the heatmap's structure and readability. Additionally, the **Meta Setting** and **Node History Setting** offer further customization options for metadata integration and node tracking, respectively, ensuring users can tailor the visualization to their specific analytical needs.

### Gene-Level CNA Heatmap

To generate a gene-level heatmap in CNAScope, begin by clicking the **Select** button to choose the gene(s) of interest from the available options, such as those listed in the gene selection interface (e.g., genes associated with the TCGA-ACC dataset). Once the desired genes are selected, click the **Render** button to process the data and visualize the results. This action triggers the rendering of a gene-level heatmap, displaying the copy number aberration (CNA) profiles across samples or cells, with rows representing observations and columns corresponding to the selected genes. The heatmap, enhanced with color gradients and interactive features, allows users to explore CNA patterns and heterogeneity effectively, as illustrated in the visualization panels.

<div align=center><img src="./DB_figures/select-gene.png" width="1000"></div>

<div align=center><img src="./DB_figures/gene-heat.png" width="1000"></div>

The interactive features of the gene-level CNA heatmap, such as zooming, highlighting, and subgroup aggregation, are consistent with those of the bin-level heatmap, providing a seamless user experience for exploring CNA data at different genomic resolutions.

### Term-Level CNA Heatmap

To create a term-level heatmap in CNAScope, start by clicking the **Select** button to choose the terms of interest, such as pathways or functional annotations (e.g., from MSigDB or KEGG) relevant to the dataset like TCGA-ACC, mirroring the gene selection process. After selecting the desired terms, click the **Render** button to generate the heatmap, which visualizes copy number aberration (CNA) profiles across samples or cells, with rows representing observations and columns corresponding to the selected terms, offering insights into pathway-level genomic alterations similar to the gene-level view.

### CNA Phylogenetic Tree
The **CNA Phylogenetic Tree** in CNAScope visually represents the evolutionary relationships among samples or cells within a dataset, such as TCGA-ACC, based on their copy number aberration (CNA) profiles. Rendered with a branching structure, the tree displays nodes corresponding to individual observations (e.g., samples or cells) and branches indicating their phylogenetic divergence, with branch lengths reflecting the degree of CNA differences.
<div align=center><img src="./DB_figures/tree.png" width="1000"></div>

### CNA Embedding Map
The CNA Embedding Map in CNAScope offers a powerful visualization of cancer copy number aberration (CNA) profiles, leveraging dimensionality reduction techniques such as UMAP, TSNE, and PCA to project the high-dimensional CNA data from datasets like TCGA-ACC into a two-dimensional space.

<div align=center><img src="./DB_figures/pca.png" width="1000"></div>

### CN Stairstep

The CN distribution can intuitively show tumor heterogeneity. The CN line plot along the chromosomes can also visually show the heterogeneity between tumor sample groups by combining genomic coordinates. By collapsing the  cases in the same tumor sample groups into one observation, we can infer the pseudo-bulk CN of each sample group. Since cancer CN line alters along chromosomes, we call it the "stairstep plot''.

<div align=center><img src="./DB_figures/p.png" width="1000"></div>

### CN Distribution
The CN Distribution visualization in CNAScope provides a detailed representation of the CN levels (total DNA content) across samples or cells within a dataset, such as TCGA-ACC, reflecting the genomic instability characteristic of cancer.

### Focal CNA & Gene

In CNVScope, we also develop readily available viz interface "Focal CNA & Gene''  for interactive and real-time visualization of CNA profiles across multiple samples.

<div align=center><img src="./DB_figures/focal.png" width="1000"></div>


"Focal CNA & Gene" displays the CNA stairsteps of all samples. The gene box shows the recurrent genes.  If the mouse hovers over the sample group in stairstep and gene box, an interactive tooltip carried its vital information will appear.
